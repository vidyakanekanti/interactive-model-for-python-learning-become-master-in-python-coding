# 🚀 Python Tutor – Interactive Learning System  

Welcome to **Python Tutor**, an interactive Python learning and testing system designed to help you master Python concepts through hands-on coding challenges!  

## 🔥 Features  
✅ Covers fundamental to advanced Python topics  
✅ Interactive coding challenges with explanations  
✅ Tracks attempts and execution time  
✅ Displays outputs only after all questions are attempted  
✅ Runs directly in **Command Prompt, Terminal, or IDLE Output Shell**  

## 🛠 How to Use  

### 1️⃣ **Running the Program**  
You can execute the script in multiple ways:  

#### ➤ Using Python in Command Prompt (Windows)  
1. Open Command Prompt (`cmd`)  
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```sh
   cd path\to\your\project
   ```
3. Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

#### ➤ Using Python in Terminal (Mac/Linux)  
1. Open Terminal  
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
3. Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python3 main.py
   ```

#### ➤ Running in **IDLE Output Shell**  
1. Open **IDLE (Python's Integrated Development Environment)**  
2. Click **File → Open**, select `main.py`  
3. Run the script by pressing **F5** or selecting **Run → Run Module**  

### 2️⃣ **Interacting with the System**  
- The program will display **coding challenges** one by one.  
- Type your solution in the input field and press **Enter**.  
- Once all questions are attempted, the system will show the **outputs** of all your solutions.  
- If there's an error, it provides feedback to help you debug.  
- The program also **tracks attempts** and execution time for each task.  

### 3️⃣ **Exiting the Program**  
- Type **"exit"** at any prompt to quit.  
- A **summary of attempts and time taken** will be displayed before exiting.  

## 💡 Example Usage  
```
🚀 Welcome to Python Tutor – Interactive Learning System  

🎯 Enter problem number (or 'exit' to quit): 1  
⌨️ Enter your code (type 'done' to finish, 'exit' to quit):  
>>> def add(a, b):  
>>>     return a + b  
>>> done  

✅ Feedback: Well done! 🎉  
```

After attempting all questions, the final output will be displayed.  

## 📌 Requirements  
- Python 3.x installed  
- Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**
